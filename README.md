# Crime-Analysis-Using-Spark-SQL
## Overview
This academic project focuses on data analysis using Spark SQL, covering data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, and comparative analysis across the counties in UK. The analysis involves structured queries and visualization to extract meaningful insights.
## Dataset
The dataset used for this project consists of crime records from various counties such as Merseyside, West Midlands, West Yorkshire, and Nottinghamshire and the data were referenced from https://data.police.uk/data/.
## Objectives
Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) using Spark SQL.
Conduct general analysis on the entire dataset.
Preprocess data to handle missing values and inconsistencies.
Analyze individual county to identify patterns and trends.
Join datasets to compare average counts between different counties.
## Implementation
The project is implemented using Apache Spark with Spark SQL for querying and data manipulation. Key technologies and libraries used include:
Apache Spark for large-scale data processing
PySpark for utilizing Spark capabilities in Python
SQL queries for structured data analysis
pandas and matplotlib for additional visualization
## Results & Findings
General trends and distributions were identified across different counties.
Data preprocessing improved the quality and consistency of the dataset.
Comparative analysis highlighted variations between counties.
Insights from Spark SQL queries provided a structured approach to analyzing large datasets.
